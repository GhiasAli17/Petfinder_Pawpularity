# Petfinder Pawpularity

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Petfinder Pawpularity Contest**. The dataset consist of pet images and meta data and we need to find the Pawpualrity score(cuteness). In addition we overiew models structure and their strength. In the end, we will propose some improvement to existing models to get better performance.

It demonstrates a **vision transformer based models**, including:  
- **Vision Transformer (Images+metadata)** model  
- **Swin transformer (Image only)** model    
- Modularized structure for datasets, models, training, and evaluation     

# Usage
